# Chrome is my desktop

I use Linux since I was twenty years old, in the year 1996. 

I loved it for server stuff: Super reliable, no need for a GUI. It was enough for me to access the
server in a terminal based fashion (via SSH).

And of course I needed an operating with a GUI to display all these terminals, my text editor, the mail client and the browser.

Since some years I used Ubuntu. Not because I think it is perfect. I use Ubuntu because I found no better alternative.

Today is the year 2020 and the times have changed.

In spent 95% of my time using Chrome. 

In the past I switched between applications with Alt+TAB. Today I use [QuickTab Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-tabs/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb?hl=en) to switch between browser tabs.

In the past I used `ctrl-r` in the terminal to search backward in this bash history. Today I use the addressbar of chrome to navigate to recent pages.

In the past I used thinderbird for mails, now I use a web based solution.

I guess sooner or later most native GUIs except Chrome will be dead.

In the past I was disappointed because Linux never gained a relevant market-share (concerning the desktop).

Now I am deeply relaxed and looking forward. Chrome will be my new desktop.

One thing I am missing: A tool like the command line tool `top` where I can see what chrome is doing.
